# Integrating with Ollama

Ollama is a powerful framework for running large language models (LLMs) locally, supporting various language models including Llama 2, Mistral, and more. Now, LobeChat supports integration with Ollama, meaning you can easily use the language models provided by Ollama to enhance your application within LobeChat.

This document will guide you on how to configure and deploy LobeChat to use Ollama:

## Running Ollama Locally

First, you need to install Ollama. For detailed steps on installing and configuring Ollama, please refer to the [Ollama Website](https://ollama.com).

## Running LobeChat Locally

Assuming you have already started the Ollama service locally on port `11434`. Run the following Docker command to start LobeChat locally:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3210:3210 -e OLLAMA_PROXY_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1 lobehub/lobe-chat
```

Now, you can use LobeChat to converse with the local LLM.

For more information on using Ollama in LobeChat, please refer to [Ollama Usage](/docs/usage/providers/ollama).

## Accessing Ollama from Non-Local Locations

When you first initiate Ollama, it is configured to allow access only from the local machine. To enable access from other domains and set up port listening, you will need to adjust the environment variables `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` and `OLLAMA_HOST` accordingly.

### Ollama Environment Variables

    `OLLAMA_HOST`         The host:port to bind to (default "127.0.0.1:11434")
    `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`      A comma separated list of allowed origins.
    `OLLAMA_MODELS`       The path to the models directory (default is "~/.ollama/models")
    `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`   The duration that models stay loaded in memory (default is "5m")
    `OLLAMA_DEBUG`        Set to 1 to enable additional debug logging

### Setting environment variables on Windows

On Windows, Ollama inherits your user and system environment variables.

1. First Quit Ollama by clicking on its tray icon and selecting Quit
2. Edit system environment variables from the control panel
3. Edit or create New variable(s) for your user account for `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`, etc.
4. Click OK/Apply to save
5. Restart it

### Setting environment variables on Mac

If Ollama is run as a macOS application, environment variables should be set using `launchctl`:

1. For each environment variable, call `launchctl setenv`.

    ```bash
    launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"
    launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"
    ```

2. Restart Ollama application.

### Setting environment variables on Linux

If Ollama is run as a systemd service, environment variables should be set using `systemctl`:

1. Edit the systemd service by calling `sudo systemctl edit ollama.service`.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl edit ollama.service
    ```

2. For each environment variable, add a line `Environment` under section `[Service]`:

    ```bash
    [Service]
    Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
    Environment="OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*"
    ```

3. Save and exit.
4. Reload `systemd` and restart Ollama:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart ollama
    ```

### Setting environment variables on Docker

If Ollama is run as a Docker container, you can add the environment variables to the `docker run` command.

For further guidance on configuration, consult the [Ollama Official Documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server).
