# Identity Verification Service

LobeChat supports the configuration of external identity verification services for internal use within enterprises/organizations to centrally manage user authorization.

Currently supported identity verification services include:

- [Auth0](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/sso-providers/auth0)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/sso-providers/microsoft-entra-id)
- [Authentik](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/sso-providers/authentik)
- [Github](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/sso-providers/github)
- [ZITADEL](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/sso-providers/zitadel)

Click on the links to view the corresponding platform's configuration documentation.

## Advanced Configuration

To simultaneously enable multiple identity verification sources, please set the `SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable, separating them with commas, for example, `auth0,azure-ad,authentik`.

The order corresponds to the display order of the SSO providers.

| SSO Provider       | Value       |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Auth0              | `auth0`     |
| Microsoft Entra ID | `azure-ad`  |
| Authentik          | `authentik` |
| Github             | `github`    |
| ZITADEL            | `zitadel`   |

## Other SSO Providers
